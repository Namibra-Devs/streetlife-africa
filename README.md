## BEM CSS Methodology

The project utilizes the BEM CSS methodology for organizing styles. Here's a quick overview of the BEM naming conventions used:

- **Blocks**: Represent independent entities on the page. Blocks are defined using class names like `.header`.
- **Elements**: Parts of a block that have no standalone meaning and are semantically tied to the block. Elements are defined using class names like `.header__title` with two underscores.
- **Modifiers**: Variations or states of a block or element. Modifiers are defined using class names like `.header--color`.
